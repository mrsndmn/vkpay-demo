# Test vkpay backend app

## Disclaimer
Sorry, but i'm not js programmer. Possibly there is exists better way to do that. But that application is just a demo that could be started easily on your localhost. It is not production solution! Just example or a sandbox.
Feel free to suggest pull requests.

Also I'm sure that if you fill the .env variables correctly you will get awesome working vkpay button.

This application can be opened only inside of vk applocation iframe.

## Getting started
Make shure that node-js and npm are installed

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env

# now you have to fill the merchant and apps parameters in .env
npm run demo-server # starting demo server
npm start # starting frontend app
```
